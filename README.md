## Geospatial Analysis

Interactive maps are created and interesting patterns are discovered using geospatial data.

This repository includes Python files for Kaggle's course on Geospatial Analysis: 

* Your first map: to plot in GeoPandas
* Coordinate reference systems: to represent the Earth's surface in 2 dimensions
* Interactive maps: to make interactive heatmaps, choropleth maps, etc.
* Manipulating geospatial data: to find locations with just the name of a place and join data based on spatial relationships
* Proximity analysis: to measure distance and explore neighboring points on a map
